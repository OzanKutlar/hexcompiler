# HexCompiler

This project serves as a compiler and executor for [Hex Casting](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hexcasting) spells.

## Features

- **Spell Modification**: You can modify the spell in your favorite text editor and then use the compiler and executor to import the spells into the game.
- **In game execution**: Using AutoHotkey, the spell is executed in Minecraft. Please note that you'll need a focus/spellbook on your other hand if you want to create longer spells
- **Automatic Slicing**: If a spell is too long for a single window, the program slices the spell into chunks which are then added into a focus/spellbook as you work.
